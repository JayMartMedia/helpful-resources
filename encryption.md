# Diffie-Hellman key exchange

The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a way for two parties to create a shared symmetric encryption key.

In this video Dr. Mike Pound combines colored water to demonstrate how Diffie-Hellman allows two parties to create a shared symmetric key without knowing the others secret key: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmM9HA2MQGI (Computerphile)

In this video Dr. Mike Pound discusses the mathmathmatics behind Diffie-Hellman, specifically the concept of how (g<sup>a</sup>)<sup>b</sup> == g<sup>a\*b</sup> == (g<sup>b</sup>)<sup>a</sup> : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yjrfm_oRO0w (Computerphile)
