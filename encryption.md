# Helpful Resources About Encryption

# RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)

RSA is a standard asymmetric (public/private) key encryption algorithm. Often used for SSH keys, TLS handshakes, and more.

# Diffie-Hellman key exchange

The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a way for two parties to create a shared symmetric encryption key.

In this video Dr. Mike Pound combines colored water to demonstrate how Diffie-Hellman allows two parties to create a shared symmetric key without knowing the others secret key: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmM9HA2MQGI (Computerphile)

In this video Dr. Mike Pound discusses the mathmathmatics behind Diffie-Hellman, specifically the concept of how (g<sup>a</sup>)<sup>b</sup> == g<sup>a\*b</sup> == (g<sup>b</sup>)<sup>a</sup> : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yjrfm_oRO0w (Computerphile)

In this video Dr. Mike Pound explains how DH is susceptible to a man-in-the-middle attack and how RSA works in conjunction with DH to protect against this: https://youtu.be/vsXMMT2CqqE (Computerphile)

# AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

AES is a standard symmetric key encryption algorithm that uses 128 bit blocks, with a 128, 192, or 256 bit key. Often used for SSL/TLS, file encryption, and more.

In this video Dr. Mike Pound discusses how and why AES was chosen as the standard symmetric key encryption algorithm: https://youtu.be/VYech-c5Dic (Computerphile)
